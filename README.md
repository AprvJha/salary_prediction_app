venv\Scripts\activate


Linux / macOS:

source venv/bin/activate


## Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Run the Flask app

python app.py


## Open your browser
Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to use the app.


## Notes
1. If you donâ€™t have the .pkl models, you can train them using the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script.
2. Ensure your Python and library versions match the ones used in development (Python 3.11+, numpy < 2).
